Storing API keys in environment variables in JavaScript is a great way to keep them secure and prevent accidental exposure. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### **Step 1: Create a `.env` File**
1. In your project root, create a file named `.env`.
2. Add your API key inside it:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_secret_api_key
   ```
3. **Important:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to GitHub.

### **Step 2: Install `dotenv`**
If you're using **Node.js**, install the `dotenv` package to load environment variables:
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### **Step 3: Load Environment Variables in JavaScript**
In your JavaScript file, import and configure `dotenv`:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

console.log(`Loaded API Key: ${apiKey}`);
```

### **Step 4: Using Environment Variables in Frontend (React, Vue, etc.)**
For frontend frameworks like React:
1. Prefix environment variables with `REACT_APP_` (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_secret_api_key`).
2. Access them in your code:
   ```javascript
   const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;
   ```

### **Step 5: Secure API Calls**
Never expose API keys directly in frontend code. Instead, use a **backend proxy** to handle API requests securely.
